# Spotify Payment Reminder Script

This script was developed with a particular need in mind: I have the Spotify family plan and share it with some family members. Each month, a person pays the amount that is automatically deducted from my credit card.

Pain point: People forgot what their payment month was, so I created a WhatsApp group to remind them, but I also forgot to update it. With that, came the idea of ​​creating a script that would check the person paying for the current month and the next. When identified, an automatic message is sent to their WhatsApp via Selenium
